**Introduction**

The GymBro application is aimed to be your buddy for the gym. The idea behind it is that with the help of GymBro you can get to know about the calories your body requires to maintain your weight. Now if your goal is to gain or lose weight we provide basic information about how to create a caloric surplus or caloric deficit so that your body changes with respect to your goals taking in consideration your body weight, height and age as basic metrics. We can also suggest workouts taking in consideration how familiar you are with exercising and later on as an add on providing supplement and nutrition knowledge will be a great add-on. First thing is to create a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) code.

**Research**

The research tells us about ways in which we can calculate calories that our body needs taking in consideration the Basal Metabolic Rate(BMR).

We need to take in consideration three major factors to do so which are weight, height and age. The metrics and units we will take as input will be discussed later on.

There are a lot of websites which provide you with calorie calculation details as well.
